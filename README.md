# Virus Game
PyGame simulation of a virus spreading through a community

There are various parameters (such as area, number of people) that can be changed for each simulation.

Clicking "run LOTS!" will run 50 simulations back-to-back.  Once complete, it will produce a plot of the average results


# Case Predictions
This code generates an [SIR Model](https://scipython.com/book/chapter-8-scipy/additional-examples/the-sir-epidemic-model/) for a specific set of inputs for a specific set of inputs.
